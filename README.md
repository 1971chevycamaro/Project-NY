# Project-NY
mission to New York controlled by a raspberry-pi onboard a hobby-class remote control car.

controls are 'w' to move forward, 'a' to turn left, 's' to move backwards, and 'd' to turn right.

mashing 'w' between intervals of 0 seconds and half a second will increase current speed by 10%

Go ahead! Although I must say that I'm new to this and I'm trying to learn how to use GitHub, please help me out I can't do this myself, it's taking to long. 

Check out the issues to see what needs to be done.
